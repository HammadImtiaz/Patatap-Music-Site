# Patatap-Music-Site
A website designed to let the user use their keyboard as a musical instrument for fun.
Designed as a project in an online course on udemy.com for web development titled "Web Development Bootcamp", instructor name: Colt Steele.
Therefore it is not and original work, just a project completed in that course for learning.
To play the game, please keep the files in the same directory/folder, extract the sounds.rar to that location where you placed the other files so that the html, css, and js files are all in one location with a folder alongside them called 'sounds' (which will be the result of .rar extraction), and open the html file in your browser.
Also ensure internet connection. The project uses a cdn link to operate the music and audio files functionality using 'howler.js' library.
